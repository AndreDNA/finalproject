   	<h2>The Point Of This Page</h2>
   	<p>This page is here to tell you why it is here in the first place.
   	<br>I am in a class called ECS(Exploring Computer Science) and we code all the time now, that is how this page was made.
   	I didn't know how fun it was going to be to code, and how simple.  We learned about the main html tags that helped make this, 
   	and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets).<br> CSS is how i was able to make the page colorful and have different sizes from box size to font size.</p>

    <p>The point of this ECS class is to have the ability to know how to use computer language
     as well as how to create pages such as this one.  We learned binary which is the language of computers, but this classes purpose 
     was to show people ho wot find a liking to the world of computers.</p>
