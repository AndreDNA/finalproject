   	<h2>About Me I Guess</h2>
   	<p>I am a teenager that goes to highschool and I am into technology as well as music.
   	<br>I love marching band and I really like being in my technology classes because they are quite fun
   	 when we do projects such as this one or work with new pieces of technology that the teacher introduces to us.</p>

    <p>My hobbies are playing the guitar, listening to music, and playing videogames.  I have two skateboards and my favorite one 
    is the longboard because it's so easy to ride and smooth which is just amazing.  I have two guitars as well, one is an acoustic, the other an electric.
      It came with an amp and I only wish I kept taking lessons to expand my skills at playing.</p>
