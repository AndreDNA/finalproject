   	<h1>The Ethical Dilemma</h1>
   	<h2>If You Had The Ability To Hack Into The School's Computer System To Change A Grade Or Two, Would You?</h2>
   	<br><p>If it where up to me and I wanted to save my skin or help out a dear friend, I probably would no matter
   	the cost, because I would want to help out a friend in need anyway that I could.  It may not exactly be legal
   	to hack into the schools computers, but the fact that you want to go to a good school and you would do
   	anything to get into one, it doesn't matter about the rationality of the situation.</p>
   	<p>I wouldn't know if all of my friends would do the same for me or not, but it doesn't matter
   	because i don't ask anything in return except for their respect, like a true friend would give another.</p>
